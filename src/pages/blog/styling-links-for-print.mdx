A few weeks ago, amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, my apartment building left a note in my mailbox. Among the helpful information and polite requests to wear masks in shared areas, I noticed a piece of text that had a very familiar style. It was blue, and underlined, and seemed to hint at a missing piece of content. In short, it was a link. Of course, this being a printed piece of mail, the link wasn't much help to me. And, while this note was certainly a Google Docs or Word document, it made me think about the way links are styled on the web.

While people aren't printing out websites at the same volume they used to, print styles are still very important. Modern browsers use these styles when saving a page as a PDF, for example. The problem is that links in this context are not always clickable. But with a little CSS we can ensure the user is always shown the URL the link points to:

```css
@media print {
	a:link[href^='http']::after {
		content: ' (' attr(href) ')';
	}

	a:link[href^='/']::after {
		content: ' (https://mywebsite.com' attr(href) ')';
	}

	a:link[href^='#'] {
		text-decoration: none;
	}
}
```

This CSS takes advantage of the `print` media query to set special styles on links in that context. Specifically, we are creating [a psuedo-element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) on links that begin with `http` (absolute links) and `/` (root-relative links). The `content` of those elements is set to the link element's `href` attribute using [the `attr` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/attr). As a bonus, we also remove the link-styling for anchor links, since those have no practical purpose in print contexts.

Of course this isn't an advised solution to _every_ link, but it is particularly useful for blog posts, technical documentation, and any content that a user might want to save to refer to later. Printing websites not be a common occurrence anymore, but setting print styles absolutely should be.

I'm a big fan of the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). I use it regularly in all sorts of projects, including this site and the API that powers the stats on the [about page](/about/). However it isn't always as clear how to do things like error handling and request timeouts as it is in libraries like [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).

If you're not familiar with `fetch`, it's a native API that massively simplifies making AJAX requests compared to the older [XHR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHTTPRequest) method, and [it's supported in all modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=fetch). When it initially landed, however, there was no easy way to handle request timeouts. You could fake it with [`Promise.race`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race) or by [wrapping your `fetch` in another Promise](https://github.com/github/fetch/issues/175#issuecomment-216791333), but these solutions don't actually cancel the request. This is where [`AbortController`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController) comes in.

`AbortController` is an API that, much like its name and my previous sentence suggests, allows us to abort (cancel) requests. Though [browser support isn't _wonderful_ at time of writing](https://caniuse.com/#feat=abortcontroller), it can be used in most modern browsers and [polyfills are available](https://github.com/mo/abortcontroller-polyfill). The API itself has a very small surface area: a `signal` property to attach to request objects, and an `abort` method to actually cancel the request. Because the API is so simple, it's very flexible -- Jake Archibald has [a fairly in-depth article on the Google Developers blog](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/abortable-fetch) going over various cancellation scenarios, as well as the history behind the API, and I highly recommend giving it a read.

With `AbortController`, it becomes trivial to cancel a request if it doesn't resolve before a given period of time: if the `abort` method is called before the request resolves (or before the response `Body` is consumed), the request is cancelled; if it's called after, the browser just ignores the call. To put it all together, we need to:

1. Create an instance of `AbortController`
1. Create a `setTimeout` function that calls the controller's `abort` method
1. Pass the controller's `signal` to `fetch`'s options object

## Putting It All Together

First, because we're basically writing a shim around `fetch`, I'm going to add an extra little perk. If the response doesn't return in the `200` range (that is, if `response.ok` evaluates to `false`), we're going to throw an error. We absolutely do not need to do this -- we could just catch our timeout and the function would work the same (we actually don't even _need_ to do that). However, I always perform this check anyways, so this removes a lot of boilerplate code for me.

Anyways, here is my generic `fetchWithTimeout` function. It should work in any environment that supports `fetch` and `AbortController`.

```js
const fetchWithTimeout = (uri, options = {}, time = 5000) => {
	// Lets set up our `AbortController`, and create a request options object
	// that includes the controller's `signal` to pass to `fetch`.
	const controller = new AbortController()
	const config = { ...options, signal: controller.signal }

	// Set a timeout limit for the request using `setTimeout`. If the body
	// of this timeout is reached before the request is completed, it will
	// be cancelled.
	const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
		controller.abort()
	}, time)

	return fetch(uri, config)
		.then((response) => {
			// Because _any_ response is considered a success to `fetch`, we
			// need to manually check that the response is in the 200 range.
			// This is typically how I handle that.
			if (!response.ok) {
				throw new Error(`${response.status}: ${response.statusText}`)
			}

			return response
		})
		.catch((error) => {
			// When we abort our `fetch`, the controller conveniently throws
			// a named error, allowing us to handle them separately from
			// other errors.
			if (error.name === 'AbortError') {
				throw new Error('Response timed out')
			}

			throw new Error(error.message)
		})
}
```

Using the function is fairly straightforward. Because we return `fetch` directly, we can use it in much the same way; the only change should be the addition of a third parameter (our `time` argument) and the extra error handling we discussed above.

```js
// This example _always_ logs the error, because I'm telling httpstat.us
// to wait at least 1s before responding, but setting the timeout
// threshold to 500ms.
// Also, this could definitely be written in async/await if you preferred.
fetchWithTimeout(
	'https://httpstat.us/200?sleep=1000',
	{ headers: { Accept: 'application/json' } },
	500
)
	.then((response) => response.json())
	.then((json) => {
		console.log(`This will never log out: ${json}`)
	})
	.catch((error) => {
		console.error(error.message)
	})
```

That's it. That's the whole post. Though the snippet is ultimately pretty simple (it's 20 lines without whitespace and comments) writing this provided me with three major benefits: it forced me to abstract the function to the most reusable version I could, it gave me an opportunity to research `AbortController` to make sure I knew exactly how it behaved, and it provided a place where I can come find this snippet in the future instead of rooting through old projects.

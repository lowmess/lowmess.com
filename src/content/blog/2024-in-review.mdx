## The Awards

### Best Screening

Portland is fortunate to have a wide variety of incredible independent theaters that show both first-run and repertory screenings. As such, the local movie culture is strong, especially around screenings are special in one way or another. Seeing a screening of the new 4k restoration of [_The Fall_](https://boxd.it/7Bqt2V) in a full theater was a blast, as was seeing an Oscars season rerun of [_Oppenheimer_](https://boxd.it/5SQVE3) in 70mm. But my favorite screening happened all the way back in January.

We get a few snowstorms a year here, but in the week leading up to the screening we had a particularly sudden & nasty one. As the programmer introduced the film, he said that the screening was almost cancelled, and I didn't doubt him. But when he joked that it might enhance our immersion, I had no way of knowing how true that was. It was my first time seeing Robert Altman's [_McCabe & Mrs. Miller_](https://boxd.it/5BMdBt), and I was watching it in glorious 35mm at the [Hollywood Theatre](https://hollywoodtheatre.org/). I would have Leonard Cohen stuck in my head for days, and jealousy pangs for Warren Beatty's coat for months. And the programmer was right: the cold sticking to my bones as the film opened instantly transported me to Presbyterian Church, Washington. I'll never forget it.

### Best Concert

As mentioned up top, in June I went to NYC for the first time (second time as well, but that's not what this is about). My dad is currently working from New Jersey, and earlier in the year I sent him a flyer for a show I thought he should go to. [Kiwi Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpQX2DhtE-0) and [Duck's Ltd.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_8fmcCTDfE) were playing a show together in Manhattan at the Knitting Factory, and tickets were somehow only $15. I think you can see where this is going: I wound up taking a cross-country flight to go to that show. And it was worth every penny. Seeing two of my favorite bands in a tiny, 150 person venue with my dad and getting a slice afterwards? Easy math. I wound up seeing Ducks Ltd. again when they came to Portland on the same tour, and they blew the doors off then too. See 'em if you can.

### Biggest Disappointment

I had a few concerts cancel on me this year, which happens but always sucks. But one of my most anticipated of the year was finally getting my chance to see [Waxahatchee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkzBs-vQgBc) after years and years of being a fan. I bought my tickets 4 or 5 months in advance, even. Sadly it was an outdoor show in Portland, and we got rained out less than halfway through her set. Luckily the rain hid my tears.

Also I flew to Minneapolis to see the Cardinals only for them to lose to the Vikings in the last minute, which sucked.

### Most Anticipated Film of 2025

There are [plenty of films](https://letterboxd.com/lowmess/watchlist/year/2025/) I'm looking forward to in 2025. There's a [mysterious new PTA](https://boxd.it/DUHM) coming, Steven Soderbergh is releasing [a spy film](https://letterboxd.com/film/black-bag-2025/), Timoth√©e Chalamet is starring in a Safdie-directed [ping pong movie](https://boxd.it/Off0), Edgar Wright is remaking [_The Running Man_](https://boxd.it/u36A) with a stacked case, and I will be seeing the new [_Mission:Impossible_](https://boxd.it/l7A2) and [_Avatar_](https://boxd.it/2W7s) films in IMAX the very second they are released. But the most anticipated film of 2025 around these parts is the same as it was at the end of 2023: Bong Joon-ho's long-delayed [_Mickey 17_](https://boxd.it/q1Dk). One of the most exciting actor's on the planet starring in a high-concept science fiction comedy from a director who has never missed? It could never be anything else.

### Most Anticipated Album of 2025

Albums don't have quite the lead time as films, so the pickings here are a bit slimmer. There are some _rumored_ albums that I'm excited about -- [Black Country, New Road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbHV8oObR54) has been [teasing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75oFpkoUG1E) [something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfLfWd8Z9PY) for [weeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJgPL3yZY0Q), for example -- but the albums with confirmed 2025 release dates is a more limited set. While I love what [Panda Bear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMNZuZe2OCY) has done on his solo releases and what [Great Grandpa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Meg6M3mAd7I) have teased of the new record so far, for me [Squid's _Cowards_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqM8hhwNsJA) is top of the list at the moment.

[^1]: It should go without saying that I was unable to see every film I wanted to see in 2024, much less the rest of the slate. I suspect several films I haven't seen yet -- _Nickel Boys_ and _A Different Man_ especially -- will find their way onto this list. Also, because I am lazy I only include films with their initial TMDb release date in 2024. So as much as loved _Sing Sing_ and _Hundreds of Beavers_, they do not qualify.

[^2]: I keep a ranked list for every year going back to 2010. This list is only for films released prior to that year.

[^3]: Is this technically an EP? Yes. Do I care? No.

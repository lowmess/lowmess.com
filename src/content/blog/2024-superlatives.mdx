### By the Numbers

- 284.4 hours watched
- 35 2024 releases seen

### Top 10 Movies

Before we get started, a few caveats:

1. I only included movies officially released in 2024 in my rankings. This means that some films that premiered earlier but didn't see wide release until 2024 (_Sing Sing_, etc.) did not make this list. You gotta cut it off somewhere and I'm too lazy to go by anything besides the release year from TMDb.
   <br />
   <br />
1. I obviously did not watch every film released in 2024. Some movies that I suspect will make this list eventually aren't yet here -- most notably _Nickel Boys_, which hasn't yet been released in Portland. Others I can see making their way into the top 10: _A Different Man_, _Between the Temples_, _Christmas Eve in Miller's Point_, and _Kraven the Hunter_. (lol could you imagine)

Ok, now onto the rankings.
